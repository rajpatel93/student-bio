        <p>Hello World, 
            <br>
            <br>
            My name is Raj Patel. I was born and raised in Cleveland, Oh (GO Browns lol) and moved to Charlotte when I was about 5 years old. I am a huge foodie that loves to cook and bake. Love to watch and play backetball, read, and watch movies. As a child I always would watch CNBC with my dad and became very fond of the market, so when I turned 16 my dad gave me a $1,000 to play around with in the market. Since that day there has not been a week where I haven't made a trade. Some people say I am addicted to gambling, but I tell them I'm addicted to risk. When I go to a casino the first thing I do is go to the roulette table and put a $100 on either red or black. If I win I know I will have a luck on my side. If you want to know more about me please feel free to ask.
